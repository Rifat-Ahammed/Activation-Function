# Activation-Function (Assignment_01) for Deep Learning
Rifat_Assignment_01: Understanding and implementing the activation function.<br/>
Throughout this article we will learn about Activation Functions with real life example and also get answer that why they are needed and what their types.

Objective:
1. To comprehend the conceptual and mathematics underpinnings of the Activation Function.
2. To execute the Activation Function in a programming language (such as Python).
3. The objective is to examine the attributes and consequences of using the Activation Function
inside neural networks.<br />

## Theoretical Understanding:
  o Explain the Activation Function, including its equation and graph.<br/>
  1. Activation fucntion:

  An activation function in a neural network is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron or a layer of neurons. It determines the output or activation level of a neuron based on the weighted sum of its inputs.<br/>
  The purpose of an activation function is to introduce non-linear transformations to the networkâ€™s computations. Without activation functions, the network would be limited to performing only linear transformations.
  
  <br/>###Equation:
    An activation function is typically represented by a function f(x) where x is the input
    to the neuron. Different activation functions have different equations. One commonly
    used activation function is the sigmoid function:<br/>
    f(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)


<br/>

  o Discuss why activation functions are used in neural networks, focusing on the role of the
   Activation function.<br/>
## Mathematical Exploration:
  o Derive the Activation function formula and demonstrate its output range.<br/>
  o Calculate the derivative of the Activation function and explain its significance in the
backpropagation process.<br/>
